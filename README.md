# House-Price-Prediction
This project aimed to develop a deep learning model to predict the benchmark
prices of single-family homes in Canada. Utilizing a combination of the MLSÂ®
Home Price Index, Consumer Price Index, and interest rate data, the model
captures the essential factors influencing the housing market. Employing a
Sequential neural network architecture with regularization techniques, the model
was trained and tested on a standardized dataset, with an 80:20 training-to-testing
data split. The performance was measured using Mean Absolute Error, with results
indicating the model's effectiveness in forecasting home prices. The study
highlights the model's potential as a valuable tool for stakeholders in making
data-driven real estate decisions.
